# 	PLAN

I am going to build a Person 2 Person sportsbetting app.  Users can register an account where they can place an available bet for other users to accept.  The initial user the places the bet will have the option to control the props/parameters of the bet in any way they want.  I will find a 3rd party API to import a schedule of upcoming Sporting events that Users can select from for their bets.

# 	For example:  
If User X wants to put up a wager that the Broncos will go 16-0 next season but he wants 500 to 1 odds, he can post that. But the bet will only be valid once another User accepts it. 

If User Y wants to put up a wager that the Broncos will go 12-4 exactly, but he wants 40 to 1 odds, once again he can do so.  But the bet will only be valid once another User accepts it. 

Other users can view all possible wagers that have been posted, and they have the option to accept any posted wager that they see as a good bet. Once a bet has been accepted, it will no longer be displayed as an available bet, but instead will be displayed as a "Set Bet" for others to see.  Usernames for each side of the wager will be displayed. 

--MVP REACHED BY THIS POINT--




#		STRETCH GOALS

Add a "Shit talking room" or forum for Users to discuss games, bets, players, etc.

Add a "Statistics Show Page" for Teams/Players.

Add a "Statistics Show Page" for Users as well?  Showing their win/loss % from their bets.
